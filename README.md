ShootEmUp
=========

Pretty bare bones shooting game. Just for kicks.

There's a player square and enemy squares come over to shoot you.

Kill them all (or let them run away) and you fight the boss. After you kill the boss, you're basically in purgatory.

Oh well.

Z TO SHOOT, X TO BOMB, ARROW KEYS TO MOVE

##How to Run

The code was written in Python 3, with the [pyglet][1] graphics library. 
We specifically used pyglet 1.2alpha1, which was the only Python3 compatible version. 
To run, install pyglet with your favourite Python package manager (like pip), or manually, and then run py -3 main.py, or the equivalent on your OS.
